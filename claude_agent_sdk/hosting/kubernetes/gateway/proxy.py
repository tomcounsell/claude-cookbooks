"""Transparent SSE relay between client and agent pod.

The gateway doesn't understand the agent's event stream — it just pipes
bytes through.  ``hosting/server.py`` inside the pod speaks Server-Sent
Events on ``POST /sessions/{id}/messages``; we open that request and
forward the raw SSE bytes to the caller without parsing them.  If the
agent's wire format changes, this file doesn't care.
