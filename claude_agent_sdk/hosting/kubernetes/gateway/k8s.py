"""
Kubernetes pod lifecycle management for agent sessions.

Creates, monitors, and deletes per-session agent pods using the K8s API.
Maintains a standby pool of pre-warmed pods so new sessions start instantly
instead of waiting 30-60s for a cold pod to pull its image and boot.

Key concepts for K8s newcomers:
- A "Pod" is the smallest deployable unit in K8s — think of it as a wrapper
  around one or more containers (we use one container per pod here).
- "Labels" are key/value tags on K8s objects.  We use them to track which pods
  are standby vs. active, and which session owns a pod.
- The K8s API is synchronous/blocking, so every call is wrapped in
  `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the async event loop.
