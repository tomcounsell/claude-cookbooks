<condition> grammar (same for scope and when):
  {"all": [<condition>, ...]}   |   {"any": [<condition>, ...]}   |   {"not": <condition>}
  {"field": "<name>", "op": "<op>", "value": <literal>}

Operators: eq, neq, gt, gte, lt, lte, in, not_in, contains, not_contains, regex, exists
- "exists" takes no value; {"not": {"field": f, "op": "exists"}} means "f is missing/null".
- "contains" on an array field checks membership; on a string field, case-insensitive substring.
- "regex" is case-insensitive.

Compilation rules:
1. Prefer operators over existing schema fields. If a clause cannot be expressed with
   operators, define a derived boolean field with a "judge" instruction and reference it.
   Only if a clause needs information available in NEITHER the content NOR the context
   (e.g. an external registry lookup), list it under "uncompilable" — never invent fields.
2. Split applicability from violation: "Alcohol ads must X" => scope: category==alcohol,
   when: NOT X. A clause with no applicability condition gets no "scope" key.
3. One clause listing several regions/categories compiles to ONE rule using the "in"
   operator — never duplicate a rule per value.
4. A clause with several independent requirements compiles to several rules (suffix ids
   a/b/c) so each violation is reported separately.
5. Missing-value semantics are handled by the engine (null => needs human review); do not
   add null-checks beyond what the policy asks for. To require a value is set, use "exists".
6. "when" may only reference extracted/derived fields. "scope" may also reference context keys.
