/**
 * The SSE proxy, and the only reason the server is in the streaming path at
 * all: the API key stays here. Everything else (accumulation, rendering,
 * reconnect) happens in the browser (see `src/lib/use-managed-agent-session.ts`).
 *
 * `event_deltas` is the query param this cookbook is about. It repeats per
 * event type: `agent.message` previews carry the reply token by token, and
 * `agent.thinking` previews are start-only: the `event_start` fires the
 * moment the model begins extended thinking, where the buffered event only
 * lands when it finishes. Without the param the same connection still works,
 * but the reply arrives as one buffered `agent.message` after seconds of
 * silence.
 *
 * The stream is a tail, not a replay: events emitted before the connection
 * existed only live in `events.list`, which is why the client re-fetches the
 * log on every connect. One connection per page, scoped to the session (not
 * a turn), opened by EventSource so the browser owns retry.
