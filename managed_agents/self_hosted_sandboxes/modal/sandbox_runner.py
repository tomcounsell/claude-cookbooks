"""Runs inside the Modal sandbox.

``client.beta.environments.work.worker(...).handle_item()`` is the whole runner:
it builds the per-session ``AgentToolContext`` at ``workdir`` and downloads the
agent's skills into ``{workdir}/skills/<name>/``, then runs a
``SessionToolRunner`` (heartbeat + reconcile + event stream + tool dispatch +
result posting) for the session, and force-stops the work item on exit. With no
per-item arguments it reads the same ``ANTHROPIC_*`` env vars
``ant beta:worker poll --on-work`` sets, which the Modal webhook injects when it
creates the sandbox.

Idle policy is the SDK default: the runner stays alive for as long as the
session has activity and exits ``DEFAULT_MAX_IDLE`` (60s) after
``session.status_idle`` with ``stop_reason: end_turn``; any other event —
including ``requires_action`` idle, where the agent is blocked on the sandbox —
resets the clock.

Env vars (injected by the webhook when it creates the sandbox):
  ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL        - API base URL
  ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_KEY - the environment key: the worker's single
                              credential. Authenticates the client (skill
                              download) and, threaded through the worker,
                              every poll / heartbeat / event-stream / force-stop
                              call.
  ANTHROPIC_SESSION_ID      - session id
  ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID  - environment id
  ANTHROPIC_WORK_ID         - work item id
